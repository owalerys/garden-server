=== algorithm ===

-if any changes were recorded issue a config reload
*-search /dev/ttyACM* for new devices and check all current connections
*-check all connections against current database
*-add any new connections
*-mark all connected connections
*-mark all disconnected connections
*-take all sensor measurements
*-activate all relays that have been manually-toggled
*-record all forced toggles --- V2
*-match the current schedule
*-evaluate all logic for the current schedule
*-check activation limits against rule activations
*-turn on all relays that should be on
*-turn off all relays that are configured but don't have an active rule
-record sensor readings in db (once per minute)
*-record activations for all rules that are active
-dispatch data recorded event (manual activations, measurements, rule activations)

=== toggle limiter ===

-if forced send on signal
-if any rule wants on and will allow then use on
-if set off but false on setTo then keep on
-if set on but false on setTo the keep off

=== sensor reading evaluation ===

-activate below min value until at or above target value
-activate above max value until at or below target value

-when in range do not switch on
-when in range keep on
-when below or above range (depend min or max) switch on

=== query actives ===

-sensor
-relay

=== events ===

-connect (return config load event)
-(return data event)
-config updated (return config load event)
-add/update/deactivate sensor (return config load event)
-rename slave (return config load event)
-add/update/deactivate relay (return config load event)
-add/update/deactivate rule (return config load event)
-add/update/deactivate schedule (return config load event)
-(return slave online/offline event)
-(return disconnect event)

=== on initialisation ===

-check all left open activations

=== active theory ===

-as a result of deletions
-hide from ui

=== possible communication failures ===

-on connect attempt
-on send
-on receive
-on disconnect attempt

=== App Views ===

-Welcome screen
-Registration screen
-Login attempt screen
-Relays screen (and add/edit view)
-Sensors screen (and add/edit view)
-Rules screen (and add/edit view)
-Slaves screen (and edit view)
