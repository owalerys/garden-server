=== algorithm ===

-search /dev/ttyACM* for new devices and check all current connections
-check all connections against current database
-add any new connections
-mark all connected connections
-mark all disconnected connections
-if any changes were recorded issue a config reload
-take all sensor measurements
-activate all relays that have been manually-toggled
-match the current schedule
-evaluate all logic for the current schedule
-check activation limits against rule activations
-turn on all relays that should be on
-turn off all relays that are configured but don't have an active rule
-record activations for all rules that are active
-dispatch data recorded event (manual activations, measurements, rule activations)

=== query actives ===

-sensor
-relay

=== events ===

-connect (return config load event)
-(return data event)
-config updated (return config load event)
-add/update/deactivate sensor (return config load event)
-rename slave (return config load event)
-add/update/deactivate relay (return config load event)
-add/update/deactivate rule (return config load event)
-add/update/deactivate schedule (return config load event)
-(return slave online/offline event)
-(return disconnect event)

=== active theory ===

-as a result of deletions
-hide from ui
